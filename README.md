# International & Intercultural Perspectives in Web Design

## Deadline
TBD (will be different for different class members, spanning multiple weeks)

## Overview
This assignment explores international and intercultural perspectives in web design by investigating how different languages and writing systems impact we design, including web typography, layout, and accessibility. You will analyze internationalization (i18n) challenges and present findings on best practices for making web content accessible across diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

**You may work in a team of two if selecting the same language.**

## Objectives
- Explore the W3C Internationalization resources.
- Choose a language from the W3C Language Matrix.
- Research the language's specific web design challenges.
- Present findings in a 10-minute presentation OR contribute to [W3C's Language Development Participation](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/pages/languagedev_participation) and submit proof of contribution.

## Resources

## Requirements

### Step 1: Language Selection
- Choose a language from the [W3C Language Matrix](https://www.w3.org/International/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) (not english).

### Step 2: Research & Analysis for the Selected Language
- Explore how cultural and linguistic differences impact web design.
- Analyze how different scripts (e.g., right-to-left, non-Latin scripts) affect layout, navigation, and readability.
- Investigate all categories (columns in the [W3C Language Matrix](https://www.w3.org/International/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html)) for your selected language. 
- Summarize key internationalization issues for the chosen language.

### Step 3: Presentation OR W3C Contribution
- Option 1: **Presentation**  
  - Create a 10-minute presentation summarizing your research.  
  - Describe the language features and cultural norms.
  - Address the challenges and solutions for internationalizing web content in your chosen language.
  - Showcase examples, compare and contrast with English.
  - Present your findings to the class.

- Option 2: **W3C Language Development Participation (Opt-out Alternative)**  
  - Actively contribute to the [W3C Language Development Participation project](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/pages/languagedev_participation).  
  - Submit a written summary (in `report.md`) detailing your contribution and its impact.  
  - Provide proof of contribution (e.g., screenshots, links to submitted work, emails confirming participation).
